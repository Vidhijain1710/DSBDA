1--Scatter plot
petal length=row
petal width=column
species=color
id=detail
can change shape
give name to sheet

2--Comparison between all species
species=column
row=PL,SL,PW,SW
drag species into color

3--Cluster Visualisation
row=petal length
column=petal width
id=detail
go into analytic section 
drag cluster into graph
 clusters are created

4---Species count(bar graph)
column=species
row=count
color=species

5--Comparison between various species based on sepal lemgth
sepal lenth=column
width=row
id=deatil
species=color

6--Comparison between various species based on sepal lemgth and sepal width and sepal width
petal lenth=column
width=row
id=deatil
species=color

7--Comparison between all
